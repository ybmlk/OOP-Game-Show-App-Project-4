Built with vanilla JavaScript for word guessing game. The program fetches a random word from Datamuse API and then displays boxes that represent each character in the word. Players can guess the hidden word by either clicking on the on-screen keyboard or typing on their keyboard. Players will be given five chances to guess the right word. After 5 unsuccessful guesses players lose. Players can choose game difficult and can also request for a hint.
